# Welcome to Seenit!

This project is a clone of the popular website [Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com).
My main goals through creating this website were to better understand cloud computing services (in this case GCP), and to
further improve my skills with React.

## Current Features 

* Creating a user account through a combination of an email, username, and password.
* Creating a new community dedicated to your favorite topics.
* Viewing posts on the home page or through a specific community page
* Commenting on posts
* Creating new posts for a community

## Future Goals

* Better CSS for the commenting system
* Transition to a lambda-type on-demand backend instead of firebase functions
* Profile page to view and edit user information
